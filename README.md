# SMBeagle v1.0.0

## Intro

SMBeagle is an (SMB) fileshare auditing tool that hunts out all files it can see in the network 
and reports if the file can be read and/or written.  All these findgins are streamed out to either
a CSV file or an elasticsearch host, or both!?  🚀

SMBeagle tries to make use of the win32 apis for maximum speed, but fails back to a slower ACL check.

It has 2 primary use cases:

### Cast a spotlight on weak share permissions.
Businesses of all sizes often have file shares with awful file permissions.  

Large businesses have sprawling shares on file servers and its not uncommon to find sensitive data with miscongiured permissions. 

Small businesses often have a small NAS in the corner of the office with no restrictions at all!

SMBeagle crawls these shares and lists out all the files it can read and write.  If it can read them, so can ransomware. 
    
### Lateral movement and privilege excalation
SMBeagle can provide penetration testers with the less obvious routes to escalate privileges and move laterally.

By outputting directly into elasticsearch, testers can quickly find readable scripts and writeable executables.

Finding watering hole attacks and unprotected passwords never felt so easy! 🐱‍👤

## Usage

The only mandatory parameter is to set an output, which should be either an elasticsearch hosts IP address or a csv file.

A good starting point is to enable fast mode and output to csv, but this CSV could get huge!

```
SMBeagle -c out.csv -f
```

### Full Usage

```
USAGE:
Output to a CSV file:
  SMBeagle -c out.csv
Output to elasticsearch (Preffered):
  SMBeagle -e 127.0.0.1
Disable network discovery and provide manual networks:
  SMBeagle -D -e 127.0.0.1 -n 192.168.12.0./23 192.168.15.0/24
Scan local filesystem too (SLOW):
  SMBeagle -e 127.0.0.1 -l
Do not enumerate ACLs (FASTER):
  SMBeagle -A -e 127.0.0.1

  -c, --csv-file                     (Group: output) Output results to a CSV
                                     file by providing filepath
  -e, --elasticsearch-host           (Group: output) Output results to
                                     elasticsearch by providing elasticsearch
                                     hostname (port is set to 9200
                                     automatically)
  -f, --fast                         Enumerate only one files permissions per
                                     directory
  -l, --scan-local-drives            Scan local drives on this machine
  -L, --exclude-local-shares         Do not scan local drives on this machine
  -D, --disable-network-discovery    Disable network discovery
  -n, --network                      Manually add network to scan
  -N, --exclude-network              Exclude a network from scanning
  -h, --host                         Manually add host to scan
  -H, --exclude-host                 Exclude a host from scanning
  -q, --quiet                        Disable unneccessary output
  -v, --verbose                      Give more output
  -m, --max-network-cidr-size        (Default: 20) Maximum network size to scan
                                     for SMB Hosts
  -A, --dont-enumerate-acls          (Default: false) Skip enumeration of file
                                     ACLs
  --help                             Display this help screen.
  --version                          Display version information.
```

## Architecture

There are a number of loosley coupled modules which hand off to each other.
